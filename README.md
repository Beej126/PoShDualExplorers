# Features
* multiple File Explorer tabs on each side
* Copy/Move Left to Right command buttons (via [FontAwesome-WindowsForms project also on GitHub](https://github.com/denwilliams/FontAwesome-WindowsForms))
* Flip flop Left <=> Right path with each other
* naturally leverages any Shell extensions already available... e.g. [Link Shell Extension](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html), [FileMenu Tools](http://www.lopesoft.com/en/filemenutools), etc.
	* this becomes my *photo filing* workspace when i download from our digicams... see [MOV to MP4 transcode script](http://www.beejblog.com/2015/11/transcode-iphone-mov-to-mp4-handbrake.html) as example "plugin"  
* infinite open potential for additional "macro" buttons naturally scripted via plain vanilla PowerShell
